As with all things for which multiple options exist, I choose GURPS over other tabletop RPG systems because I personally prefer it.
However, as someone who likes to think of themselves as rational, I have some reasons.

I'll get into some explanation of the system as I go, but I won't get terribly deep as I'm not writing a book.

___

###Predictability
One of my core annoyances with DnD and Pathfinder is the handling of Critical Misses/Hits.
I don't trip once every 20 steps, just as much as I don't have profound insights every 20 thoughts.
Sure hit confirmation can lower the impact (5% -> .25%), but bad rolls in general are not only easy, they feel common.

In d20 systems, all probabilities lie on a flat line.
GURPS, on the other hand, uses 3d6 for most rolls. This results in a nice bell curve of possibility.
As a result, skills can more easily be modeled to reflect their various learning curves and properly have
diminishing returns on improvement.

Additionally, succeeding/failing by more then 10 counts as a critical. 
I always thought it weird in other systems that masters and novices at any given skill had equal chances
of critically succeeding and critically failing.

As a GM, it's also nice to have a good feeling of "it's usually a roll of 12 or less", especially when rolling for
pure luck or making an encounter table.

###Disadvantages
GURPS has some disadvantages as a system, but that's not what I'm talking about.

In GURPS, a character can have certain mental, physical, and social disadvantages. 
These function in a reasonable way as compared to a real person.

As both a player and a GM, the concept of disadvantages in an RPG is intriguing in its own right.
Rather than playing a character as afraid of spiders just to be obtuse and challenge myself,
I can write it down on the sheet in a binding way; I'll even get extra character points to spend on other things!

Some example disadvantages:
- Missing Limbs
- Code of Honor
- Phobias
- Being part of a subjugated class/race
- Clumsiness
- Sadism
- Honesty

Note how disadvantages don't strictly have to be *evil* traits. Many of them are traits expected of a *good* person.
Anything that limits your choices, be it kindness, clumsiness, curiosity, or just plain smelling bad, is a disadvantage.

Whenever I create a new character, I start with the disadvantages. 
From my point of view, it's our limits that define us, so why should it be anything else that defines our characters?

____

###Flexibility
I mentioned character points earlier without introducing them as a concept, but they are central to GURPS.
Most tabletop RPGs have a concept of character level, character class, and perhaps experience points.
In GURPS, there are no classes, no levels, and no experience points. 
Those are all replaced by character points.

Character points can be considered the currency of traits. 
They go into buying all aspects of a character that are unique 
or otherwise cannot be bought with money (as equipment usually can).

Any character, be it an NPC, a Player Character, a Monster, or even a special object, 
can be built with character points. 
Anything built with points is simply a collection of Attributes, Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills 
(a couple other things exist, but function nearly identical to one of those three).

Instead of having classes like Ranger, we'd instead have a character with: 
- High Dexterity and HT (Health, much like Constitution in other games, not to be confused with Hitpoints)
- Animal Empathy
- Potentially an Ally (for the animal companion)
- Several Woodland Survival Skills (Hiking, Climbing, Swimming, Survival (Woodland), Bow, etc)
- A Sense of Duty to Nature
- Other Stuff

With this system, it's possible to create any sort of character and progress it in any direction.
When talking to newcomers, I like to say 

> You'd only need the core book to make an invisible vampire frog that is blue

They usually ask how it's blue if it's invisible, so I mention that there are ways to pierce the veil of invisibility.

____

###Progression Curve

As mentioned above, GURPS doesn't have levels. 
I personally prefer a gradual improvement to characters, 
rather than massive power spikes that aren't directly tied to story events.

The difference between a level 1 character and a level 2 character is huge in most systems.
The difference between a 50 point and a 60 point character in GURPS is much much smaller.

With a greater continuity of power, I can more easily design encounters for players.
Additionally players don't get bogged down randomly with a bunch of choices and 
instead work to improve constantly, just as in real life.

___

###Modularity
As with all things, GURPS isn't perfect. 
However, there isn't much interaction between modules and rules.
For example, I don't personally care for the social system/skills in GURPS, 
I prefer to have my players play their roles to determine outcomes.
If someone wants to play a careful or thoughtful character while personally being impulsive,
they can pick up the Common Sense advantage to have me politely remind them when they stray.

I can easily drop the social system by just telling players not to take social skills as I don't use them.
No classes depend on such skills to be effective because there are no classes.
I make some exceptions for ineloquent players that wish to have orators for characters, 
but I tend to ask for the gist of what they want to speak about and weigh my decision on NPC reaction based
on that far more than their roll.

Additionally, the default magic system is a bit unfaithful to many of my settings, but I can easily substitute in
my own. Any "spell" I want available can be phrased as an existing Advantage or skill
with several modifiers (I usually still make a special Advantage/Skill for the players to record, but I base its
cost on how I can build it out of the existing system).

The core book supports everything from cavemen to star wars in tech, but it's trivial to choose a tech level 
or three to lock in for the players.

## Upcoming Blog Stuff

This was mostly a fluff post. Going forward, I'll have a bit of a series (or at least tag) 
on various settings I've made for GURPS.
Each one should get a post to explain its motivation and real-world background/history as well as a page to 
explain the setting.
