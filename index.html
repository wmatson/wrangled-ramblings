    <hr/><p>As with all things for which multiple options exist, I choose GURPS over other tabletop RPG systems because I personally prefer it. However, as someone who likes to think of themselves as rational, I have some reasons.</p><p>I'll get into some explanation of the system as I go, but I won't get terribly deep as I'm not writing a book.</p><hr/><h3 id="predictability">Predictability</h3><p>One of my core annoyances with DnD and Pathfinder is the handling of Critical Misses/Hits. I don't trip once every 20 steps, just as much as I don't have profound insights every 20 thoughts. Sure hit confirmation can lower the impact (5% -> .25%), but bad rolls in general are not only easy, they feel common.</p><p>In d20 systems, all probabilities lie on a flat line. GURPS, on the other hand, uses 3d6 for most rolls. This results in a nice bell curve of possibility. As a result, skills can more easily be modeled to reflect their various learning curves and properly have diminishing returns on improvement.</p><p>Additionally, succeeding/failing by more then 10 counts as a critical.  I always thought it weird in other systems that masters and novices at any given skill had equal chances of critically succeeding and critically failing.</p><p>As a GM, it's also nice to have a good feeling of "it's usually a roll of 12 or less", especially when rolling for pure luck or making an encounter table.</p><hr/><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><p>GURPS has some disadvantages as a system, but that's not what I'm talking about.</p><p>In GURPS, a character can have certain mental, physical, and social disadvantages.  These function in a reasonable way as compared to a real person.</p><p>As both a player and a GM, the concept of disadvantages in an RPG is intriguing in its own right. Rather than playing a character as afraid of spiders just to be obtuse and challenge myself, I can write it down on the sheet in a binding way; I'll even get extra character points to spend on other things!</p><p>Some example disadvantages:</p><ul><li>Missing Limbs</li><li>Code of Honor</li><li>Phobias</li><li>Being part of a subjugated class/race</li><li>Clumsiness</li><li>Sadism</li><li>Honesty</li></ul><p>Note how disadvantages don't strictly have to be <em>evil</em> traits. Many of them are traits expected of a <em>good</em> person. Anything that limits your choices, be it kindness, clumsiness, curiosity, or just plain smelling bad, is a disadvantage.</p><p>Whenever I create a new character, I start with the disadvantages.  From my point of view, it's our limits that define us, so why should it be anything else that defines our characters?</p><hr/><h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3><p>I mentioned character points earlier without introducing them as a concept, but they are central to GURPS. Most tabletop RPGs have a concept of character level, character class, and perhaps experience points. In GURPS, there are no classes, no levels, and no experience points.  Those are all replaced by character points.</p><p>Character points can be considered the currency of traits.  They go into buying all aspects of a character that are unique  or otherwise cannot be bought with money (as equipment usually can).</p><p>Any character, be it an NPC, a Player Character, a Monster, or even a special object,  can be built with character points.  Anything built with points is simply a collection of Attributes, Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills  (a couple other things exist, but function nearly identical to one of those three).</p><p>Instead of having classes like Ranger, we'd instead have a character with: </p><ul><li>High Dexterity and HT (Health, much like Constitution in other games, not to be confused with Hitpoints)</li><li>Animal Empathy</li><li>Potentially an Ally (for the animal companion)</li><li>Several Woodland Survival Skills (Hiking, Climbing, Swimming, Survival (Woodland), Bow, etc)</li><li>A Sense of Duty to Nature</li><li>Other Stuff</li></ul><p>With this system, it's possible to create any sort of character and progress it in any direction. When talking to newcomers, I like to say </p><blockquote><p> You'd only need the core book to make an invisible vampire frog that is blue </p></blockquote><p>They usually ask how it's blue if it's invisible, so I mention that there are ways to pierce the veil of invisibility.</p><hr/><h3 id="progression&#95;curve">Progression Curve</h3><p>As mentioned above, GURPS doesn't have levels.  I personally prefer a gradual improvement to characters,  rather than massive power spikes that aren't directly tied to story events.</p><p>The difference between a level 1 character and a level 2 character is huge in most systems. The difference between a 50 point and a 60 point character in GURPS is much much smaller.</p><p>With a greater continuity of power, I can more easily design encounters for players. Additionally players don't get bogged down randomly with a bunch of choices and  instead work to improve constantly, just as in real life.</p><hr/><h3 id="modularity">Modularity</h3><p>As with all things, GURPS isn't perfect.  However, there isn't much interaction between modules and rules. For example, I don't personally care for the social system/skills in GURPS,  I prefer to have my players play their roles to determine outcomes. If someone wants to play a careful or thoughtful character while personally being impulsive, they can pick up the Common Sense advantage to have me politely remind them when they stray.</p><p>I can easily drop the social system by just telling players not to take social skills as I don't use them. No classes depend on such skills to be effective because there are no classes. I make some exceptions for ineloquent players that wish to have orators for characters,  but I tend to ask for the gist of what they want to speak about and weigh my decision on NPC reaction based on that far more than their roll.</p><p>Additionally, the default magic system is a bit unfaithful to many of my settings, but I can easily substitute in my own. Any "spell" I want available can be phrased as an existing Advantage or skill with several modifiers (I usually still make a special Advantage/Skill for the players to record, but I base its cost on how I can build it out of the existing system).</p><p>The core book supports everything from cavemen to star wars in tech, but it's trivial to choose a tech level  or three to lock in for the players.</p><hr/><h2 id="upcoming&#95;blog&#95;stuff">Upcoming Blog Stuff</h2><p>This was mostly a fluff post. Going forward, I'll have a bit of a series (or at least tag)  on various settings I've made for GURPS. Each one should get a post to explain its motivation and real-world background/history as well as a page to  explain the setting.</p>
